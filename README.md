# Politics of Energy Transition Final Project
## Question ##

How does the support of environment change for Americans when tested over a few variables? I will test 3 variables in this file
1. Average Crude Oil Price In a Year
2. Total Lobbying Firm Money Spent In a Year
3. The Year over year-over-year change of Average Gas Price

Why is this important?

Using these methods can help Politicians or NGOs gain better clarity as to what makes Americans value the Environment over different scenarios, and how important their principles are when challenged through a variety of circumstances (high gas prices for example).
